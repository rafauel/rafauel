### Hi my name is Rafael Antonio 👋

💼 **Senior Software Engineer | Senior Software Developer at Ânima Educação | C#, .NET, .NET Core, PHP, LARAVEL, AWS and so on.**

More than 10 years in the area of software development as a professional. My main programming language has always been PHP, but always accompanied by other skills.

I had the opportunity to manage several projects where I was responsible for their architecture and planning. I have always excelled in software and architecture project management, always thinking about the best performance and the future scenario of all the applications I managed over the years.

In all the projects I developed, I always looked for innovation and safety, I had the opportunity to work with great professionals and different technologies.
